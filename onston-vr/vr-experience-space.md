ONSTON's metaverse does not start from empty land. The foundation initially prepares basic sights and entertainment for users. By providing various spaces such as amusement parks, concert halls, and shopping centers in advance, users can predict what they can do with empty spaces, helping to fill new spaces.

Among the VR experience spaces, the amusement park provides independent VR images for each ride, and users use a small amount of ONSTON tokens to use them. And by installing billboards in every corner of the amusement park, companies can use ONSTON to place advertisements, thereby connecting users and companies.
