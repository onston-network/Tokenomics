# Guild DAO system

Guild Community is a community formed by guilds from many areas in ONSTON Metaverse to seek to develop respective areas.

In each AREA, users can form multiple guilds and the representative AREA guild is selected by users who own ONSTON governance and can participate in the management of applicable AREA.

The AREA representative guild is given a right to operate shops and a right to sell, lend and demonstrate own signature NFT or other productions.

Some areas are offered to guild on ONSTON. The provided AREAs are cultivated by guilds in collaboration. Concerts or amusement parks and other cultural entertainment facilities are developed so that profits from sales and lending can be enjoyed, or their own landmark can be built in the AREA.
