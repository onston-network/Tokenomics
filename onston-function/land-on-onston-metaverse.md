# LAND

## What is ONSTON's Land

Users are given LAND of own space where wide range of free activities are ensured within Metaverse.

Users can make LAND as an independent space by applying own smart contract with unique rules. They can arrange and decorate own space with buildings and furniture they make, and even invite different users and use together.

The purchase, sale, and rental of LAND via ONSTON.

## New Land with Auction

ONSTON's land is an asset. Users compete for a space that other users may like, and ONSTON periodically offers a certain area of space to users by way of an auction. All of these auctions are made in ONSTON currency, and all auction proceeds are publicly burned to help the soundness of ONSTON's economy.

## LAND FOR GUILD

ONSTON provides LAND for guilds.

Guilds can use given LAND, and LANDs differ in sizes and locations according to contributions by guilds in Metaverse. The provided LANDs can be variously used such as economic activities and Landmark construction.
