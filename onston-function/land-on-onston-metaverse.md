# LAND

## What is ONSTON's Land

LAND stands for logical compartments in the ONSTON metaverse. The area of the early ONSTON metaverse was a performance hall for the MR metaverse established by the ONSTON Foundation, a VR amusement park, etc. A variety of sample spaces are provided, and users can expect profits by building a new experience space here and using it directly or renting it to others.

The purchase, sale, and rental of LAND via ONSTON.

## New Land with Auction

ONSTON's land is an asset. Users compete for a space that other users may like, and ONSTON periodically offers a certain area of space to users by way of an auction. All of these auctions are made in ONSTON currency, and all auction proceeds are publicly burned to help the soundness of ONSTON's economy.
