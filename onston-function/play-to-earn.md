# Play to Earn

Play to Earn with ONSTON Metaverse on Marketplace.

Today, users and businesses can port real assets and services into a virtual, decentralized environment called a metaverse. One way to invite more real-world assets to the metaverse is to bring together the concept of space and time laid out on an interoperable blockchain.

By relying on NFTs for users and economic activity models in space, users can participate in construction, use, financial economy, etc. in the metaverse and be rewarded for the value they add for space and experimental challenges. Play-to-earning is used on the blockchain, so it is also fair on the metaverse. This is because users take full ownership of their assets instead of controlling most of their space, facilities, and content by traditional enterprises.
