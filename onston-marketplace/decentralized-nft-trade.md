# Decentralized NFT trade

## NFT Marketplace

Non-fungible tokens, more commonly known as NFTs, are the latest trend in the decentralized marketplace. NFTs are tokens typically used to authenticate digital ownership of physical assets attached to tokens, allowing creators to release work digitally without the risk of forgery. Due to this, land, buildings, and objects, including avatars in the ONSTON metaverse, can be recognized for their ownership and copyright and lead to safe economic activities.

## Marketplace economy

All elements that make up ONSTON Metaverse are all made of NFTs. It is the ONSTON Project that provides the initial space of the metaverse, but since all spaces, structures, and contents created, cultivated, and used are NFTized and used, users can register NFTs in the market at any time, and registered NFT objects use ONSTON Creator. Through various processes of merging or transforming through various processes, it is possible to upgrade to MR 3D objects with various textures that can be used in the ONSTON metaverse.
