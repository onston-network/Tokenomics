# Decentralized-Finance

## De-Fi in Metaverse

Lend for build, Lend for make new experience space with ONSTON

Land in the ONSTON metaverse is considered an asset just like in the real world. The original land is sold fairly to users through a smart contract auction, and the land can be used to build a licensed building or run a farm, or to decorate one's own living space in the plot where the purchased use is determined.

## Share your right with Smart Contract

The land purchased in this way can be registered in the market according to the user's intention in accordance with the market economy to the next user after a certain period of time, or the land can be periodically received as ONSTON and the right can be loaned through a smart contract for a certain period of time.

Buyers can borrow ONSTON to purchase other assets by providing a certain percentage of their assets as collateral in the market, and all these processes are done in a decentralized way through smart contracts.
